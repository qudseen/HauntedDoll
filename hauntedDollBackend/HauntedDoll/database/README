Various ways to load, drop, and look at the database. All require the environment
variables ORACLE_USER, etc., and the two tunnels for the databases working.
Note that you'll have two H2 databases, one on pe07, one on your home system.

1. Use these scripts -- they cover all the needed cases.

For database H2, use runH2Script.sh/runH2Script.cmd:
runH2Script.sh createdb.sql   (for Windows, drop the .sh)
runH2Script.sh showdb.sql
runH2Script.sh dropdb.sql

Scripts for pe07's mysql and dbs3's oracle: For home use (or on pe07), use these shell scripts. 
They use a JDBC program inside h2.jar to run the SQL script (no use of the H2 database here)
runOracleScript.sh createdb.sql, etc. (for Windows, drop the .sh)
runMysqlScript.sh createdb.sql, etc.

Special case: running scripts from pe07 itself: we can use mysql and sqlplus there
runOracleScriptLocal.sh and runMysqlScriptLocal.sh are meant only for pe07, using
   its system programs sqlplus and mysql. 
   
2. Alternatively, if you have ant installed at home, it gives you one way that works both on 
pe07 and at home, once you have defined ORACLE_USER, etc.
On pe07, ant is already installed.
ant load-oradb
ant show-oradb
ant drop-oradb
ant load-mysqldb
ant show-mysqldb
ant drop-mysqldb
ant load-h2
ant show-h2
ant drop-h2
